# Beautiful code rules!

### Main rules for clean Python code:

- **Use 4 spaces** for indentation (no tabs).
- Write variable and function names in **snake_case** (my_variable).
- Name classes in CamelCase style (MyClass).
- Use **clear and meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Use docstrings** to describe the purpose of functions and classes.
- Limit line length to 79-80 characters for readability.
- Avoid writing too long functions — **break code into small logical blocks**.
- **Use comments** to explain *why* something is done, not *what* the code does.
- Organize imports: standard libraries, third-party libraries, local modules.
- Avoid global variables, use functions and classes.
- Use exception handling for error management.
- Follow consistent code style — **PEP8**.
- **DRY - don't repeat yourself**: extract repeating parts into separate functions.

### Additional rules:

- **Use f-strings** (f"text {variable}") for string formatting.
- Try to write functions with a single level of abstraction.
- Use generators and list comprehensions for more concise code.
- **Write tests** for important functions and components.
- Use typing hints if the project allows it.
- Keep namespace clean — import only what you need.
- Document non-obvious or complex algorithms.
- Maintain **consistency in quote style** (‘ ’ or “ ”) throughout the project.
